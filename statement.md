# Problem Statement
Many individuals and households are unaware of simple, day-to-day actions they can take to reduce their energy consumption, leading to higher electricity bills and a larger carbon footprint. The lack of easily accessible, categorized, and actionable tips prevents them from making immediate, impactful changes.

# Scope of the Project
This project's scope is limited to a "command-line application" that randomly generates pre-defined energy-saving tips based on user-selected household categories (lighting, heating, kitchen, electronics, general). It focuses on "presenting information" and does not involve data storage, complex calculations, integration with external APIs, or real-time monitoring.

# Target Users
* Students: Working on similar basic programming projects.
* General Household Users: Seeking quick, simple, and categorized advice to lower their utility bills and improve energy efficiency.
* Educators/Trainers: Needing a basic tool to demonstrate energy-saving concepts.

# High-Level Features
* Area Selection: Users can choose from five primary household areas.
* Tip Retrieval: The system retrieves and displays a random, contextually relevant energy-saving tip for the selected area.
* Continuous Query: The user can continue to request more tips for the current area or switch to a new area until they choose to exit.
