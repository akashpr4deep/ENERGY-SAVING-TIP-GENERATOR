# ENERGY-SAVING-TIP-GENERATOR

# Overview Of The Project
This is a simple, command line Python application designed to help users save energy at home by providing random, actionable energy-saving tips across different household areas. The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to repeatedly get tips for the same category or switch to a new category.

# Features
* Categorized Tips: Provides energy-saving tips for five distinct areas: lighting , heating , kitchen , electronics , and general.
* Randomized Output: A different, random tip is generated and displayed from the category's list each time the user requests more tips.
* Interactive Menu: Allows the user to repeatedly view tips for the current area or change to a different area.
* Input Validation: Handles invalid category inputs by prompting the user to enter a correct area.

# Technologies/Tools Used 
* Language: Python 3
* Core Libraries: The built-in "random" module is used for selecting tips.

# Steps to Install & Run the Project 
1. Requirement: Ensure you have "Python 3" installed on your operating system.
2. Download the Code: Save the provided source code into a single file named `energy_tip_generator.py`.
3. Run the Application: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and execute the following command:
   python energy_tip_generator.py

# Instructions for Testing
Since this is a simple console application, testing primarily involves checking the functionality in the terminal.

1.  Start the program as described above.
2.  Test Valid Inputs: Enter each of the following categories when prompted and verify that a unique, relevant tip is displayed:
    * lighting
    * heating
    * kitchen
    * electronics
    * general
3.  Test 'More Tips' Loop: After receiving a tip, enter "y" to see another tip for the same area, and then enter "n" to exit the inner loop and proceed to the 'change area' prompt.
4.  Test 'Change Area' Loop: Enter "y" when prompted to change the area and repeat steps 2 & 3. Enter "n"to exit the entire program and verify the "Thank You" message is displayed.
5.  Test Invalid Input: Enter a non-listed category (e.g., "bedroom") and verify the "Enter the correct area." message is displayed.
